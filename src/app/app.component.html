      I am Anna, I am 27 years old, and I am a writer â€“ out of passion. <br><br> The power of words
      is astonishing. One sentence can shape the surroundings of the reader
      from a sunny day to a cold starless winterâ€™s night. One paragraph can
      make a reader cry. One page can change their life.
      That is what always fascinated me about writing, about words.
      <br><br>
      But when I grew older, another interest took shape: natural sciences. Currently, I am finishing my
      masterâ€™s degree in Geosciences. During the last years, I was able to learn
      about our planet and how it works, and about life itself. That is why I
      also love writing about natural sciences.
      <br><br>
      PS: I was born in Austria, and therefore my mother tongue is German. Regardless, I am fluent in English and Spanish, and I have basic
      skills in French.

      <h2>Creative Writing</h2>
      Fancy a story that was written just for yourself? The occasion or reason does not matter. It can be a present to your husband or an
      e-book you want to sell on Amazon. What do you need to do to get it started? Naturally, this depends on what your requirements are.
      You can just give me a word and Iâ€™ll create a new world for you, or you can give me exact instructions on everything, and Iâ€™ll put it
      on paper. There are no limits â€“ I am a creative thinker, so I do not need to follow the rules. It does not have to be a story that
      starts at A and ends at Z. What about a narrative that has a different ending every time you read it?

      <h2>Natural Sciences</h2>
      As I am studying Geosciences, I have a basic understanding of all kinds of natural sciences like biology, chemistry, and physics. This
      gives me the ability to understand and write texts on these topics. I would love to put this knowledge into easy words everybody can
      comprehend. Furthermore, I am up to do thorough research. During the you have to respect for papers, theses, and so on.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      Without a doubt, this depends on various factors. Do I have to do a lot of research, or can I just sit down and write? Do I have to
      give up the rights to my writing? Do you want to put the text on the market and make money out of it?

      <h2>Give me a rough estimation!</h2>
      To give you an idea, for Creative Writing I would generally ask you for 3 cents (Euros) per word, if I should subrogate the rights to
      you it is 4 cents per word. For texts on natural sciences, the most common price is 4 to 5 cents per word.
