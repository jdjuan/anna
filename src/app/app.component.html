      I am Anna, I am 27 years old, and I am a writer – out of passion. Since I
      was a teenager, I have been reading and writing a lot. The power of words
      is astonishing. One sentence can chance the surroundings of the reader
      from a sunny day to a cold, starless winter’s night. One paragraph can
      make a reader cry. One page can change their life. That is what always
      fascinated me about writing, about words. But when I grew older, another
      interest took shape: natural sciences. Currently, I am finishing my
      master’s degree in Geosciences. During the last years, I was able to learn
      about our planet and how it works, and about life itself. That is why I
      also love writing about natural sciences.

      <h2>Creative Writing</h2>
      Fancy a story that was written just for yourself? The occasion or reason does not matter. It can be a present toyour husband or an
      e-book you want to sell on Amazon. What do you need to do to get it started? Naturally, this depends on what your requirements are.
      You can just give me a word and I’ll create a new world for you, or you can give me exact instructions on everything, and I’ll put it
      on paper. There are no limits – I am a creative thinker, so I do not need to follow the rules. It does not have to be a story that
      starts at A and ends at Z. What about a narrative that has a different ending every time you read it?

      <h2>Natural Sciences</h2>
      As I am studying Geosciences, I have a basic understanding of all kinds of natural sciences like biology, chemistry, and physics. This
      gives me the ability to understand and write texts on these topics. I would love to put this knowledge into easy words everybody can
      comprehend. Furthermore, I am up to do thorough research. During the you have to respect for papers, theses, and so on.
